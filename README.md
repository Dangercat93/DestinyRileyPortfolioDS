# **Destiny Riley's Data Science Portfolio**
### A collection of my favorite, highest-performing projects from my time in the data science boot camp offered by Woz-U.
##### *Attendance dates: July 2021 - April 2022*


## **Basic Statistics**
#### ***T-Test Scenario #1***  - An independent t-test comparing the occurrence of nouns in Shakespeareâ€™s As You Like It and Julius Caesar plays
#### ***T-Test Scenario #2***  - A single sample t-test comparing the highest temperatures of every major city in Texas to the highest recorded temperature in Denton, TX
#### ***T-Test Scenario #3***  - A dependent t-test comparing the heart rates of Airmen at the beginning and end of their skydiving jumps

## **Intermediate Statistics**
#### ***Basic ANOVA Using Python*** - Evaluating if there is a significant difference between the volume of avocados sold in Indianapolis, Orlando, and Phoenix/Tucson
#### ***Basic ANOVA Using R*** - Evaluating whether the average price of avocados varies between Albany, Seattle, and Houston
#### ***Intermediate Statistics Final Project*** - Given four scenarios, I had to evaluate which hypothesis test to run out of a one-way ANOVA, one proportion z test, two proportion z test, and independent Chi-square. After determining the correct test, I tested the appropriate assumptions and stated my conclusions
#### ***MANOVA Project*** -  Evaluating if gender influenced heart attack predictors such as blood pressure and cholesterol. Tested for MANOVA assumptions and subsequently ran the MANOVA

## **Machine Learning & Modeling**
#### ***Nonlinear Regression*** - Based on a given dataset, I was challenged to analyze two sets of X and Y variables by creating a scatterplot and determining whether the variables showed exponential or quadratic relationships

## **Statistical Programming in R**
#### ***Thinking Like a Programmer*** - A solution to a word problem that required creative problem solving
#### ***Functions & For Loops*** - Taking on the role of working for an ice vendor, I created a for loop that used a diam() function to calculate given weights in grams
#### ***Dependent t-Test*** - An evaluation of whether or not there is a statistical difference between the first 25 years and last 25 years of a dataset recording the mean annual temperature in New Haven, CT from 1912 to 1971 (Code and text analysis included)
